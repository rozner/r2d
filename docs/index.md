## Common Notation

Instance methods with `method/=` means both `method` and `method=` are available to get and set attributes.

## Getting Started

To write a simple R2D application, first `require` the `r2d` gem:

```ruby
require 'r2d'
```

Next, create a new window instance using the [Window](/docs/window/concepts.html) class.

```ruby
window = R2D::Window.new
```

Then, create a new shape:

```ruby
s = R2D::Square.new(0, 0, 100, "red")
```

And add the shape to the window:

```ruby
window.add(s)
```

When ready to show the window, call the `show` method.

```ruby
window.show
```
